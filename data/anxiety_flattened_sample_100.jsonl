He rents from a lady who owns a very small hairdresser with a flat above it (the flat also has stairs and downstairs living area and kitchen behind the shop) this is causing us some problems. Traditional lenders don’t want to know and because the floor space of the shop is under 40% of the total area commercial mortgages pointed us to residential ones. Expecting that this might make our life easier because we can access a 10% deposit etc I awaited the email from the mortgage broker only to offer us a mortgage which required a £91,000 deposit and a 10% interest rate. No.\n\nWe wish to keep the shop and use the income from it to essentially live for free\n\nI’m wondering if there is a different way around this, currently the whole building is held under one title.\n\nCould we split the title and essentially  buy the shop from her for a token amount and then place the whole mortgage on to the flat as a standard residential? \n\nAny advice or help at all would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!

Sunlight?[body]Hi,\nI was lying in bed at about 2 am thinking about how the fact one day I’ll be in a box in the ground as many brains often do, and threw myself into a panic. The next day I had what I now discovered to be DPDR feelings. My thoughts feel completely fine but everything else in the world seems too bright, a bit like I’m stoned  stoned - I spoke to a friend and it turned out he actually had the identical thing happen and eventually it did go away. I waited for it to go away and it’s sort of did  \n\nI’m struggling to know what to do because it always seems to happen again in sunlight. I have no idea why this is happening as I absolutely love the sun. I’m always out side on a sunny day. I love being at the beach and it is where I am at my happiest , also, I have never experienced any severe emotional issues. I’ve never been particularly depressed although I have had minor anxiety here and there I just can’t figure out what is going wrong with my head.\n\nIs there anyone that can help me with this in anyway, as I don’t see it lasting forever but I also can’t seem to find a way to alter my perceptions?"}

It seems a few others have said this, is this the case with every pair? I hope not! I don’t find the immersive audio to do anything other than drop the quality either, which I don’t really care about (I didn’t buy them for that purpose) - but is this bashing right? Surely not. It sounds like the speakers are being jolted around. Horrific! "}

{"id": "1cn0gb9", "text": "[title]My blur is moving? [body]I don’t know if this is just me, but I’m hopefully going to find someone with a similar experience. When I am looking at those bright white LED lights in shops or when there is a strip of light with a dark foreground, I am noticing a blur moving across my field of vision in both eyes but only on the light part. The image of what I’m looking at is fine. . It looks exactly like the blur that you would see on a Google image description of astigmatism except it moves as a wave either left or right and doesn’t last very long, I’ve only noticed it recently but I can’t figure out if it’s always been there. Has anyone else had this?"}

{"id": "1cl0m0m", "text": "[title]Numb chin syndrome?[body]Hello. I have what I can only find online as numb chin syndrome, but I also can’t find any experience similar to mine. \n\nI have a small pinprick sensation right in the middle of my chin, no numbness. It went away for a few days and came back. This sometimes gives me a bit of anxiety, and of course my anxiety usually manifests in the form of giving me tingling everywhere else (I once had a lot of this all over my body lasting months in about 2018, and it has been manifesting like that since) \n\nAside from that, it also sometimes feels cold in that area, and swallowing a cold drink also makes it feel cold there. \n\n I have an infection under a lower first molar incorrectly carried out RCT that’s been there for a few years. Had an OPG last year showing that. \n\nTrying to figure out what this could be, I can’t find anyone else saying about the cold sensations? Any pointers would be very useful. Thanks! "}
